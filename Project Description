  Problem statement and list of users:
      The doctor - patient portal is chosen to be our project since it’s convenient for doctors, nurses and patients. 
Firstly, it is environment friendlier to keep track of our medical records digitally rather than physically, 
which also lower the risk of losing important documents. With the portal, both doctors and patients can have access 
to the patients’ medical history and prescriptions. Besides, sometimes it’s difficult to reach our doctors, and the 
portal can be an easy way to communicate between doctors and patients. On top of that, patients can easily schedule 
a doctor appointment using the portal, and doctors can also manage their working schedule however they want.
